# Awesome Active Admin

In this book we will leverage the powerful but occasionally complex Active Admin tool.

Active Admin is an auto-generating Rails CMS admin panel, similar to the Django Admin panel.

This tool allows developers to quickly prototype and create usable form-based CMSes based solely on your Rails models.

Although not suitable for every app, Active Admin lets you build things really fast and is a key Gem in any Rails developer's arsenal.

In this book we will create a custom CMS product to allow an organization to manage their web presence and update their array of services.

We will cover:

* Installing Active Admin
* Managing Users and creating Roles
* Adding Models to Active Admin
* Nesting resources within Active Admin panel
* Customizing the look and feel for Active Admin
* Create an admin dashboard

Beyond Active Admin you'll learn how to:

* Create an attractive website frontend with Sass and Bootstrap
* Create a search form with Sphinx
* Build Rails models and a MySQL backed website
* Test and Deploy your site to AWS or Heroku
