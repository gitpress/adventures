# Mastering Middleman

In this book we will learn how to build developer and client friendly websites using the powerful Ruby app Middleman. Middleman is a "static site" tool. It offers tools and a workflow to help you build the elements needed to create complex static sites with the added bonus of Ruby tools and templating.

This book will show you how to build sites with Middleman that are as good, if not better, than WordPress and Rails.

We will get to know Middleman through several projects. However, I would encourage you to also get your hands dirty going off the path offered by myself. The best learning is always achieved when you experiment and test yourself.

Hopefully this book will however, give you the tools to do so confidently and without stress.
