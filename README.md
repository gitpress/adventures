# Preface

Welcome to Adventures in Web Development. This series will guide you to become a web developer.

The guides are written to be as helpful to a beginner as possible, a position I found myself in not too long ago.

Although I am now a developer, I myself do not have a traditional background in computer science. In fact, I left school at the age of 14 with no qualifications.

I found many books, courses and information available poorly suited to help me gain the skills required to be confident enough to get a job building applications - never mind build worthwhile products.

This series represents the information and instruction I wish I had as a beginner.
