# Building Websites with WordPress

This short book is an action-packed guide to help you quickly and efficently build professional websites with WordPress.

This book will show you how to design, build and extend WordPress to create flexible products.

One of the things I found with WordPress books and documentation previously is that they spend too much time on the very easy things (How you write a blog post) 
but also very little on the extremely important things (how to create custom post types like "Services").

In this book we will:

  1. Create a custom post type
  2. Create custom theme templates
  3. Leverage WordPress Loops and Templating features
  4. Write a simple plugin
  5. Leverage Bootstrap and Sass to create an attractive theme
