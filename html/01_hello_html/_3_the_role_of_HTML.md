# The role of HTML

HTML provides the foundations or structure to websites. It is a "markup" language that defines what a browser needs to display.

It looks like this:

```html
<p>Hello World!</p>
```

HTML is used to communicate to browsers, and related products, how things should be constructed.

```html
<p>Some things <strong>need</strong> extra focus</p>
```

Take a look at a Newspaper or a book. Inside that you'll see headings, sub-headings, paragraphs. You may also see areas assigned for images. If you have an academic treatise nearby, you may also see a footer where references are made to ramblings of other academics.

In a printed book, the headings, the footer, the paragraphs all communicate a structure that helps create a common pattern so that readers (you and I) are able digest and navigate through a book's information.

HTML provides the structure similar to that we find in a book, but on a webpage or app. HTML wraps content (literally!) and the browser communicates the structure to us. 

So, when you write HTML you are building the structure into which information, data, is injected. Your structure is vitally important to the readability and usefulness of your document to a reader. Your HTML is vitally important to ensure your document creates a structure that is consumed in the way you intend it to be consumed.

HTML is the common structure of the web. It is a way of telling browsers how to build something, what to put in certain containers and what containers belong in certain silos.

HTML doesn't do it alone. We have CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which provides the styling and JavaScript which adds a layer of interactivity and polish to use too. This book won't really focus on those two technologies (forthcoming books will though!) but it will give you the ability to start leveraging them soon enough.
