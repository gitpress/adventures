# How the web works

In this chapter we will quickly go over how you get web pages. We won't spend too much time here. The reason being is that it is often easier to understand by building things rather than theory.

when you load up a webpage you send a command to "get" a html page

Send a message to a DNS server


## HTML or HTM?

To make a document a HTML file you just need to save a file as a .html file. So, instead of .doc, .txt etc. you make your file end with .html

No magic. No extra process.

Now you may come across a file or two ending with .htm

This is the same thing as .html It is just an alternative way of writing it. Convention however means .html is what is preferred.
