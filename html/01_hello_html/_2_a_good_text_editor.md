# The right tools

One the most important tools to use is a good web browser. I personally use Google Chrome but Firefox is another great alternative. I would also recommend you install IE11 if possible too.

A professional developer needs to test their site in as many browsers as possible so collecting browsers and machines is very important.

Another key tool is a good text editor. As your HTML basically text, a text editor is essential for any web developer. At the moment there are quite a few choices and ultimately it can come down to personal preferance. Here are a few:

### Text Editors

#### Sublime Text

This is one of the most popular text editors around. You can buy it for around $80 but they also offer an unlimited trial version which should be good for a web beginner. [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is a great product but development appears to have slowed recently but it remains one of the best, if not **the** best text editor around.

#### Atom.io

[Atom.io](https://atom.io/) is one of the newer text editors around. It is now open source and free. It is developed by [GitHub](https://github.com/) a collaborative platform that developers use to host and share code. It is still early in its development but offers a lot of potential. It is similar to Sublime Text.

> If GitHub and other terms feel a bit intimidating, don't worry. Every learner feels the same. So many terms and technologies. Keep on trucking. You'll soon get a handle on them!

#### TextMate

[TextMate](http://macromates.com/) is a popular text editor for the Mac platform.

#### NotePad++

[NotePad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is a classic Windows text editor that has been around a good while. It is lightweight and fast and a great fit for Windows machines. If you ever find your PC running slow using an IDE or editor, NotePad++ is a great choice.

> Why is it faster? The reason is that NotePad++ is written in "native" code. Native code is essentially the language an Operating System (OS) or computer is written in. Native code speaks the language of the computer and therefore the computer can execute programs more efficently. If you take a programming language that doesn't compile/create Native language, it needs to translate itself or have a program do that for it. This extra process, however small, makes something slower (or require more CPU to process thereby potentially running slower if you are also using other programs at the same time)

#### Brackets.io

Brackets is an under development text editor designed and developed by Adobe. It is apparently very popular and you can find out more on the [Bracket website](http://brackets.io/).

If you are a designer or have some experience with Adobe products it may be a good fit.

#### Caret (for ChromeOS)

[Caret](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml?hl=en) is  the best choice for local file editing on a Chromebook. I have a Chromebook which I use to either edit through the browser or with Caret. It is essentially a Sublime Text alterntaive for Chromebooks. Well worth a download.

#### Vi, Vim or Emacs

All three of Vi, Vim or Emacs are developer-focused tools that let you edit text and process commands without touching a mouse. They are all very complicated and require some learning to use. Once you master one you'll be seriously productive but for a learner I think they are likely a bit advanced.

### IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)

#### Aptana Studio

[Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3.html) is a free IDE that also has tools for Ruby/Rails development. If you are wondering what an IDE is, it is essentially a super-charged text editor that may come with extra tooling/functionality specific to building certain applications or using certain programming languages. For HTML it is a bit overkill but if you have aspirations for developing serious applications getting used to an IDE isn't a bad idea.

#### Visual Studio

[Visual Studio Community](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-gb/products/visual-studio-community-vs) is another very powerful product that is a bit overkill just for HTML but has some great tools and if you use Windows is a great option.

### In-browser IDEs

#### Codio

Of all of the in-browser IDEs, [Codio](https://codio.com/) is probably the most reliable, flexible and easy to use. It is the product I use the most. I am in fact writing this very book using it. The free tier is extremely powerful and they have just redesigned the platform to ensure it is easier to use and easier to set up common platforms.

Peraonlly, If I am not using Sublime Text on my Linux Laptpo, I am normally using Codio.

#### Cloud 9

Like Codio, [Cloud 9][https://c9.io/] is an in-browser development environment with a good free tier. As with Codio, there is some additional or alternative steps you'll have to jump over to get databases etc. installed. However, when it comes to HTML there is nothing extra to do.

#### Nitrous

[Nitrous](https://www.nitrous.io/) is another option for in browser development environment. The free tier is limited to one project at a time so it is less flexible that Codio or Cloud 9.

### But what do you use?

For HTML I would recommend Sublime Text (it also works well for Windows, Mac and Linux) and the full version can be evaluated for free (an unlimited evaluation of the paid version). The browser-based development environment of [Codio](http://www.codio.com) is also a good bet. I use it for work and have few complaints.

I also recommend using Codio if you are on a windows machine as  it runs a linux machine underneath and unless you are planning on being a windows dev (C# etc), you will need to learn how to develop on linux. It also mixes the ability to create things like you would on Windows without abandoning the command line or Linux way of doing things.
