A good text editor is essential for any web developer. At the moment there are a fair few good choices and ultimately it can come down to personal preferance. Here are a few:

## Text Editors

#### Sublime Text

This is one of the most popular text editors around. You can buy it for around $80 but they also offer an unlimited trial version which should be good for a web beginner.

Atom.io

TextMate

#### NotePad++

[NotePad++]() is a classic Windows text editor that has been around a good while.

#### Brackets.io

Brackets is an under development text editor designed and developed by Adobe. It is apparently very popular and you can find out more on the [Bracket website](http://brackets.io/).


#### Caret (for ChromeOS)

## IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)

#### Aptana Studio

[Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3.html) is a free IDE that also has tools for Ruby/Rails development. If you are wondering what an IDE is, it is essentially a super-charged text editor that may come with extra tooling/functionality specific to building certain applications or using certain programming languages. For HTML it is a bit overkill.

## In-browser IDEs


Codio

Cloud 9

Nitrous



In this book I will generally use Sublime Text which as I mentioned previously, can be evaluated for free (an unlimited evaluation). The browser-based development environment of [Codio](http://www.codio.com) which leverages the "integrated development environment" of Ice IDE is also a good bet. 

An IDE is essentially a text editor designed to come with extra syntax highlighting (basically colour coding your code) and the ability for other additional features to be bolted on top.

I recommend using Codio if you are on a windows machine
