A good text editor is essential for any web developer. At the moment there are a fair few good choices and ultimately it can come down to personal preferance. Here are a few:

## Text Editors

#### Sublime Text

This is one of the most popular text editors around. You can buy it for around $80 but they also offer an unlimited trial version which should be good for a web beginner.

Atom.io

TextMate

#### NotePad++

[NotePad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is a classic Windows text editor that has been around a good while. It is lightweight and fast and a great fit for Windows machines. If you ever find your PC running slow using an IDE or editor, NotePad++ is a great choice.

> Why is it faster? The reason is that NotePad++ is written in "native" code. Native code is essentially the language an Operating System (OS) or computer is written in. Native code speaks the language of the computer and therefore the computer can execute programs more efficently. If you take a programming language that doesn't compile/create Native language, it needs to translate itself or have a program do that for it. This extra process, however small, makes something slower (or require more CPU to process thereby potentially running slower if you are also using other programs at the same time)

#### Brackets.io

Brackets is an under development text editor designed and developed by Adobe. It is apparently very popular and you can find out more on the [Bracket website](http://brackets.io/).

If you are a designer or have some experience with Adobe products it may be a good fit.

#### Caret (for ChromeOS)

[Caret]() is  the best choice for local file editing on a Chromebook. I have a Chromebook which I use to either edit through the browser or with Caret. It is essentially a Sublime Text alterntaive for Chromebooks. Well worth a downloa.

## IDEs (Integrated Development Environment)

#### Aptana Studio

[Aptana Studio](http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3.html) is a free IDE that also has tools for Ruby/Rails development. If you are wondering what an IDE is, it is essentially a super-charged text editor that may come with extra tooling/functionality specific to building certain applications or using certain programming languages. For HTML it is a bit overkill.

## In-browser IDEs


Codio

Cloud 9

Nitrous



In this book I will generally use Sublime Text which as I mentioned previously, can be evaluated for free (an unlimited evaluation). The browser-based development environment of [Codio](http://www.codio.com) which leverages the "integrated development environment" of Ice IDE is also a good bet. 

An IDE is essentially a text editor designed to come with extra syntax highlighting (basically colour coding your code) and the ability for other additional features to be bolted on top.

I recommend using Codio if you are on a windows machine
