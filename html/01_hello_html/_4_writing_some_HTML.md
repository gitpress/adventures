# Writing some HTML

About time? Ok, crack open your text editor of choice 

> Not MS Word okay! If you skipped the section about text editors and didn't install or get a developer friendly text editor time to take a detour and do that.

In a new file write the following:

```html
<head>
<title>Cat Herding 101</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
</body>
```

Save the file as **"hello.html"**. Make sure you save the file as a .html file. If you saved the file and it is called something like hello.html.txt remove the .txt to make it a real html file.

On your computer you'll likely see your .html file adopt the icon of your browser of choice

{{{{{{ INSERT IMG }}}}}}

Double click it and admire your awesome awesomeness!

Did everything appear as you expected?

The content between the **<title></title>** tags didn't show up on the page. The reason for this is that the title tags designate the *title* of your html document to the browser. If you look at your browser tab you should see if.

{{{{{{{{ INSERT IMG }}}}}}}}

```html
<a href="#">This is a link to nowhere</a>
```
