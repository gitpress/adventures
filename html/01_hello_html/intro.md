# Hello HTML

Welcome to the book proper. In this chapter we will ensure you have everything ready for your journey into web development. By the end of chapter you will have a good grasp on web development using HTML.

The role that HTML plays in web development is it provides the foundations or structure to your document. Take a look at a Newspaper or a book. Inside that you'll see headings, sub-headings, paragraphs. You may also see areas assigned for images. If you have an academic treatise nearby, you may also see a footer where references are made to ramblings of other academics.

Headings, the footer, each paragraph communicates a structure that helps create a common pattern so that readers (you and I) are able digest and navigate through a book's information.

Think about the table of contents in a book. The contents are structured in a list from top to bottom of each chapter or section. This structure, of a list, enables people to quickly navigate to the information they need.

When you write HTML you are building the structure into which information, data, is injected. Your structure is vitally important to the readability and usefulness of your document to a reader. Your HTML is vitally important to ensure your document creates a structure that is consumed in the way you intend it to be consumed.

HTML is the common structure of the web. It is a way of telling browsers how to build something, what to put in certain containers and what containers belong in certain silos.

HTML doesn't do it alone. We have CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) which provides the styling and JavaScript which adds a layer of interactivity and polish to use too. This book won't really focus on those two technologies (forthcoming books will though!) but it will give you the ability to start leveraging them soon enough.
