In this chapter we have covered a lot of ground. We talked about:

* How your browser gets and renders a HTML page
* What text editors are available
* the role of HTML
* How to write some basic HTML
* How the major HTML elements and attributes work
* What a basic HTML web server looks like

Hopefully you've gotten a good sense of what HTML is and how to read it, if not give you the confidence to write some basic HTML yourself.

A good exercise to getting used to writing HTML is to pick up a local paper or journal and translate the articles into some HTML. Do this to get an appreciation of writing some HTML. Make sure to google any mistakes you make.

> If you found any of the concepts in this chapter either difficult to understand, or found any concept not covered so far something that blocked you from really getting the concept of HTML please email me and I will address this. [Contact me by email](mailto:grillopress@gmail.com)
