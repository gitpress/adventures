# Further Resources

In this chapter I will set up some challenges and tasks for you to complete before going through some useful resources. The challenges are representitive of minor mistakes you are likely to make writing HTML. 

> Remember, making mistakes is absolutely fine. If you are not making mistakes you are not pushing yourself. Just calmly try to diagnose what is wrong. Google any error messages or issues you find. If needs be, walk away for a bit. Countless times have I struggled with a problem on Friday and solved the issue in seconds on Monday. You can do it!

## Challenges

## Resources

[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - great resource for HTML, CSS and JS. If you are struggling with a specific HTML or CSS issue many developers suggest using MDN with your search term is the best thing to do.

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Stackoverflow is another resource you'll bump into searching for information. The quality of questions and answers can vary but it is a great thing to have in your toolkit.

[Github](https://github.com/) & [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/) - Github is a place where people share and collaborate on code and Gists is a place people can save little bits of code that they don't want to lose or they feel would be useful for other people. It is a great option to search for something and have many people offer real world solutions to things. If you do find a solution or use someone else's code just be sure to reference them appropriately.

[jsbeautifer](http://jsbeautifier.org/) - This little program is a good tool to help beautify your HTML or JavaScript. Basically, it just makes sure you have indented everything right. As you learn you shouldn't really need it as much but occasionally when you are rapidly building things it is a quick clean up tool. Similarly, if you are building HTML emails, with countless table elements, it can be a godsend.
