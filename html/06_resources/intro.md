# Further Resources

In this short chapter I will set up some challenges and tasks for you to complete before going through some useful resources. The "challenges" are representitive of minor mistakes you are likely to make writing HTML or good practice to get a handle on writing HTML. 

> Remember, making mistakes is absolutely fine. If you are not making mistakes you are not pushing yourself. Just calmly try to diagnose what is wrong. Google any error messages or issues you find. If needs be, walk away for a bit. Countless times have I struggled with a problem on Friday and solved the issue in seconds on Monday. You can do it!

## Challenges

To get the most out of tech books, you have to go off-road a little. A good book will get you going but the best learning you do will be built on top of that foundation. The below are hopefully something to help with that.

#### Projects

1. To get used to writing HTML it is good practice to write some! Get a copy of your local paper or something similar and try to build the page and articles structure using HTML. Don't worry about styles (unless you want to!)
2. At the heart of every journey to learning HTML and web development is the need to build plenty of websites. Start with a bragging webpage where you convert your CV into HTML.
3. Imagine you get a call from your Aunt. She is a premier swordmaking  smithy with a good mailing list. However, she doesn't have a custom email template and she knows that good email campaigns and bring in the big bucks. Design a HTML email for her business, maybe a special discount offer for loyal customers, as well as an accomplying webpage
4. If you enjoyed the taste of Bootstrap, dig deeper in to the documentation. Build yourself a Bootstrap website. If you want a theme a little different from the default style visit [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/), find a theme you like, download the files as CSS and link your page to it
5. Not a HTML challenge as such. Find a website or app you find really easy to use and draw it on a scrap of paper. Translate the sections into HTML. Look at the elements that make up the website or app. What bits are repeated. What stays constant?

#### Puzzles

1. The below code doesn't work. My img tag doesn't show an img. Can you work out why?
  * Using href instead of src
2. Not having much luck today, now my video won't work.
  * mispelled https://
3. Everything is structured right, but something is wrong and it isn't the CSS.
  * unclosed b tag
4. My CSS is in a folder called CSS and a file called styles.css but it doesn't load. Why not?
  * using style element incorrectly
5. Ok last one I promise. Now my docs won't download! The doc is in a folder called docs and it iself called form.pdf
  * incorrect use of \ instead of /

## Resources

[Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/) - great resource for HTML, CSS and JS. If you are struggling with a specific HTML or CSS issue many developers suggest using MDN with your search term is the best thing to do.

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) - Stackoverflow is another resource you'll bump into searching for information. The quality of questions and answers can vary but it is a great thing to have in your toolkit.

[Github](https://github.com/) & [Github Gists](https://gist.github.com/) - Github is a place where people share and collaborate on code and Gists is a place people can save little bits of code that they don't want to lose or they feel would be useful for other people. It is a great option to search for something and have many people offer real world solutions to things. If you do find a solution or use someone else's code just be sure to reference them appropriately.

[jsbeautifer](http://jsbeautifier.org/) - This little program is a good tool to help beautify your HTML or JavaScript. Basically, it just makes sure you have indented everything right. As you learn you shouldn't really need it as much but occasionally when you are rapidly building things it is a quick clean up tool. Similarly, if you are building HTML emails, with countless table elements, it can be a godsend.
