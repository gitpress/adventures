# HTML Typography

I am taking Typography here to mean the very broad sense of writing or arranging things to "print" out the written word.

Much like a a printing machine, we wrap words and letters within these HTML tags to "print" out text to our screen in a meaningful and structured way.

> When you encounter the word Typography in connection with the web, it is often in relation to changing fonts, or the finer elements of designing your website's space between letters etc. This isn't what we'll cover in this chapter. This is about setting up our page to print out paragraphs etc.
