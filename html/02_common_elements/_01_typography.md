# HTML Typography

I am taking Typography here to mean the very broad sense of writing or arranging things to "print" out the written word.

Much like a a printing machine, we wrap words and letters within these HTML tags to "print" out text to our screen in a meaningful and structured way.

> When you encounter the word Typography in connection with the web, it is often in relation to changing fonts, or the finer elements of designing your website's space between letters etc. This isn't what we'll cover in this chapter. This is about setting up our page to print out paragraphs, quotes and things like that

## Headings

One of the most common elements you'll use is a heading or header. These are indicated by a "h" followed by a number (with a max of 6). 

To indicate something is the top heading in a page we wrap our text with ```<h1></h1>```. And to indicate a header of the lowest importance we use ```<h6></h6>```.

You should generally treat headings as gears in your car. You start with the first, move to second and then third. Whenever you start moving, you start low and progress up. So, if you need to start a new section you start and move up.

There is a slight caveat here. It is best to only use one ```<h1></h1>``` per page.

This is because things like "screenreaders" use them to understand the most important or defining header of a page. Basically, the title or essence of a page.

So, taking screenreaders into account it is best to reserve your ```<h1>First Heading</h1>``` to the most important title on your page.

This very book shows this in action. 

The name of the chapter or section starts with a ```<h1></h1>``` element, in this case **HTML Typography**, with each preceeding section using a ```<h2></h2>``` element to indicate the important sub-sections.
