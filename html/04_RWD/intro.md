# Responsive Web Design

The technique of responsive web design (or RWD) is a little beyond this book, though the concept is not. Essentially, RWD is the collection of techniques where a web page responds to the size of the users' screen or browser size.

Essentially then, a website is programmed to check is this screen over or under 800 pixels. If it is under, reduce the size of things and stack them on top of each other, if it is over stay the course.
