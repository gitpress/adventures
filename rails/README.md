# Your first adventures with Rails

a range of quick and dirty adventures with Rails with each project focusing on a part of Rails with the aim of just teaching little by little and ignoring that which doesn't need to be covered just yet.

Ideas:

Introduce minimal "why rails rocks" website with Rails.

Then do a tour of mini-books on each elements with small projects. Get them in a productive groove

Rails "CMS" with Active Admin and simple views?
